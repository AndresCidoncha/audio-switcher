Gnome-Shell Extension Audio-Input-Switcher
==========================================

This extension adds a little entry to the status-menu that shows the currently
selected pulse-audio-input device. Clicking on that will open a submenu with
all available input devices and let's you choose which one to use.

Most importantly this extension is a s simple as possible. Therefore it does not
include an output switcher or similar.
See Audio-Output-Switcher (https://github.com/anduchs/audio-output-switcher) 
extension for speaker selection.
